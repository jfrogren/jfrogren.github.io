The phd project is not an isolated project but belongs to a research program called UserAge which is a six-year program entaila four universities, and also user representatives in form of for example representatives of senior citizens, and also a group of international scientific experts.

My PhD project is not the only one but there are three other PhD students doing projects within the frames of the research program, each of us belonging to one of the universities involved.

The focus of the research program is different kinds of user involvement in research.
